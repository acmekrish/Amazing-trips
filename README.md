# Amazin Trips

A basic React application for a travel destination wishlist.

## Features
- Display a list of travel destinations
- Add new destinations
- Remove a destination
- Mark destinations as visited
- Filter destinations by all, visited, and non-visited
- Responsive design
- Data persistence using localStorage

## Usage
- Visit the deployed web app [here](DEPLOYMENT_LINK)
- Add, remove, and manage your travel destinations.

## Assumptions and Additional Features
- Simple validation is added to ensure no empty fields are submitted.
- If given more time, I would add more advanced form validation, better styling, and potentially integrate a backend for persistent data storage.
